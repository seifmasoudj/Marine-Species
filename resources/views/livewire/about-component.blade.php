              Zanzibar Marine Species Information System Is part of raising and producing 
              marine organisms with the aim of boosting the economy and increasing 
              employment for young people. Zanzibar is one of the areas that have 
              invested in these projects by building a large place for marine species.
              Given that Zanzibar is surrounded by the Indian Ocean on all its islands, 
              the revolutionary government of Zanzibar saw fit to establish and build a 
              major center for these activities with the aim of boosting the economy and
              providing opportunities and jobs for its citizens. Due to the current
              president of Zanzibarâ€™s emphasis on investing in the blue economy has led me to want 
              to create a web system that will record the information of all species.
